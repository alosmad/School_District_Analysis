# School_District_Analysis


After collecting the information from different schools from the same district we started this analysis by removing all the values that will alter our analysis, we found out that there were a lot of scores not captured so we decided to remove them from the database.

Overall we found out that Charter schools perform better across most of the grades in math although they have less budget.
This analysis should be complemented with a deeper analysis on budget by school type, this could be done for math and reading scores.
